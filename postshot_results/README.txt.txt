In order to being able to upload the files to git I had to edit the results with postshot by removing a lot of gaussians.
This makes the result look cleaner imo, but it is not the direct output that one would get when running the pipeline
with my provided input images.
Feel free to test Postshot with my input data or message me to see the original output.
